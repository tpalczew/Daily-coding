'''

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬, corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010 10101100. 
The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.

For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.
