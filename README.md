# Daily-coding

Here is my repo for daily coding. Following the inspirational quote "If you don't use it you lose it" here I'll do some coding exercises. 

There are only Python coding questions in this repository. The SQL directory containes a simple example how to set you environment to start runing some queries but no sql questions here.
